Over time, we have needed to fix problems in the
[libcangjie  data](https://github.com/Cangjians/libcangjie).

We often made manual changes on limited parts of the data, but sometimes we
needed to make more systematic changes in a programmatic ways.

This repository contains a set of scripts we used for such modifications.
